# What Kind of Contributions can be made?

## Contributing Code
If you are a programmer and want to help to improve, fix or extend the implementation of the chat-app please create a branch or fork of the current `master` branch using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and make your changes on that branch.

Then please create a pull request and ask for a review by one of the core team members (e.g. `poldi2015`).
The reviewers will either ask you to work in review findings or if there are none, merge your branch.

## Try out and testing
We are happy if you experiment with the chat-app!

If you find a bug, please let us know by writing a mail to poldi at thatswing.de.

## Ideas
Last but not least if you have ideas for ways to improve or extend the chat-app, feel free to write a mail.
